                <h1>Why Do we Travel</h1>
                <p>There are a lot of reasons to travel. Some people travel for fun while some do it for education
                    purposes. Similarly, others have business reasons to travel. In order to travel, one must first get
                    an idea of their financial situation and then proceed.</p>
                <p>Understanding your own reality helps people make good travel decisions. If people gave enough
                    opportunities to travel, they set out on the journey. People going on educational tours get a
                    first-hand experience of everything theyâ€™ve read in the text.</p>
                <p>Similarly, people who travel for fun get to experience and indulge in refreshing things which may
                    serve as a stress reducer in their lives. The culture, architecture, cuisine and more of the place
                    can open our mind to new things.</p>

                <h1>The Benefits of Travelling</h1>
                <p>There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The first one being, we get to meet
                    new people. When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends. It may be a
                    fellow traveller or the local you asked for directions.</p>
                <p>Moreover, new age technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them. Thus, it offers not only
                    a great way to understand human nature but also explore new places with those friends to make your
                    trip easy.</p>
                <p>Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand people. You will learn how other
                    people eat, speak, live and more. When you get out of your comfort zone, you will become more
                    sensitive towards other cultures and the people.

                    Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills. When you go to hilly
                    areas, you will most likely trek and thus, trekking will be a new skill added to your list.</p>
                <p>Similarly, scuba diving or more can also be learned while travelling. A very important thing which
                    travelling teaches us is to enjoy nature. It helps us appreciate the true beauty of the earth.</p>
